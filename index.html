He is one of the finest saxophone and flute players in the world today, who specialises in Jazz and Bollywood. We have had him perform at many of our events too, much to the delight of our audiences. Recently Vikas has also started providing yeoman service to adding new talent to the industry by teaching youngsters too.

I cannot but say that he is a superb saxophonist and his teaching skills are remarkable. The range of his repertoire has always surprised me because I have rarely heard him repeat himself during public performances. His range varies from old to new Bollywood songs, Classical music and Western jazz. He has been playing the saxophone since the last 22 years. I believe that he deserves every opportunity whereby he can exploit his talent and reach out to people with his music.</h3>
